      <dt id="api">Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) Streaming</dt>
      <dd>&nbsp;A method of video streaming over the Internet, primarily over HTTP, where the source content is encoded at multiple bitrates, then each bit rate streams are segmented into smaller chunks of data. Depending on the available bandwidth, the quality of the media delivered to the client can improve or degrade; thus the Adaptive part.</dd>
      <dt id="api">Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</dt>
      <dd>This is a specification for the symmetric key encryption (where both communicating ends have the same encryption key) of electronic data established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). It is part of Stream Security. AES is usually followed by a number, such as AES-128 or AES-256, which refer to the cipher block size in bits. The higher the number, the more secure the encryption is.</dd>
